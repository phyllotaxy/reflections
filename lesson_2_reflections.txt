What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
If there was no staging area, everything inside the working directory would be
committed each time. There might be logically unrelated groups that are better
separated, and there might be logically related files that should be committed
together. The staging area offers this flexibility and without it, everything in
the working directory are considered to be logically related.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
Before the commit, always use "git diff --staged" to verify that the commit that
is about the happen is really one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branches are created when one version cannot be compared with another version.
(partial order) If the project goes into some experimental direction, then it
makes sense to branch instead of keeping a total order, because one cannot say
that the experimental version is better (wrt features, bugs) than the master
branch (if it does not work, then it's worse), or the other way around (if it
works, then it is better).
Branches allow you to have a production, quality branch that never breaks
(master), together with development branch, experimental branch, etc.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams show the branch names and commits that are reachable. Moreover,
command "git log --graph --online" accept more than two arguments, which can
potentially show all the branches in a single graph.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
