When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1. Cooperate with others. 2. Backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
When working with other people, your changes might not be accepted. In that case
it is very bad to have Git automatically stay up to date with the remote repo.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?
Branches involve only one repository. Cloning and forking, on the other hand,
involve two repositories. Forking refers to cloning a repository from GitHub to
GitHub, whereas cloning refers to all other situations. One uses forking when
there is no permission to modify the original remote repository from someone
else. Branching is used when one wants to create two versions of the repo that
cannot be compared. It does not involve permission and one can access any branch
of the repo.
